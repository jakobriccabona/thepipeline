the purpose of this repository is to have a shared pipeline that is used by everyone in the lab.

This is the beta version.

Notes:
energy-analysis: here, every mutation is hard coded. Needs to be rewritten
interface_design: python specific dependencies for generation_mutation_list.py (argparse, pandas)
esm: analysis_mpnn.ipynb; change notebook to a python script. pdb2fasta.py dependencies: Biopython
pross: evaluation is different, will be changed.
